		<h1><b>About This Site</b></h1>
		<hr>
		<p>This site is about unblocking censorship, exploits, or just unblocking blocked websites from your School in general, </p>
    		<p>The main purpose of the site was so to make students feel more powerful whenever it comes to school-related blocked things. and to just unblock already blocked websites/apps/ulities.</p>
		<p>This website is still currently ongoing, so as of now new updates will roll out each day/week, Be patient!</p>
		<p>If you have any ideas for this work in progress website, let me know on my business email: thewhatrtrtukk@gmail.com</p>
