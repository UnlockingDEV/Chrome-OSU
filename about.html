			<h1><b>About This Site</b></h1>         
        		<p>This site is about unblocking censorship, exploits, or just unblocking blocked websites from your School in general, </p>

			<p>This website is still currently in Alpha, so as of now new updates will roll out each day/week, Be patient!</p>
			<p>If you have any ideas for this work in progress website, let me know on my email: thewhatrtrtukk@gmail.com</p>
